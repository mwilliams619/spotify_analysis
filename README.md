TO VISUALLY INTERPRET THE DATA GENERATED BELOW USE GEPHI https://gephi.org/

first create a spotify developer app on developer.spotify.com to get login credentials (client_id and client_secret)

At the bottom of SpotifyClassDef.py a code snippet is available to generate nodes and edges for the Pollen playlist and the song passionfruit by drake

The nodes and edges will generate csv files which can be viualized when uploaded into gephi
